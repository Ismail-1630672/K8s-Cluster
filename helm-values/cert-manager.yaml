#A custom resource definition extends Kubernetes allowing controllers such as cert-manager
#to manage custom resources such as certificates, cluster issuers, and issuer
#as if they were native kubernetes objects.

extraArgs:
- --dns01-recursive-nameservers="8.8.8.8:53"
- --dns01-recursive-nameservers-only

#These extraArgs configure cert manager so that it uses reliable and public DNS's for dns-01 
#challenges or dns resolutions rather than relying on built in cluster DNS (coreDNS)
#which can be unreliable and cached potentially leading to ACME validation failures.
